            <p>Gender-based violence (GBV) remains a critical issue in South Africa, with high rates of violence against women and girls. Despite legal frameworks and policies aimed at addressing GBV, it continues to be a widespread problem, further exacerbated by societal norms.

            <p>In South Africa, gender-based violence is still a major problem, especially when it comes to women. It can take many different forms, including sexual assault, harassment, and domestic abuse. I approached this issue artistically by creating a triptych that contrasts the gravity of gender-based violence with the philosophical teachings of Buddhism and the calm and contemplative art of tea in ancient East Asia. East Asian tea culture is rooted in tradition and suggests peace, respect and awareness. In addition to providing something to drink, the custom of making and serving tea promotes a feeling of community and connection. Tea drinking is considered a meditative practice in Buddhism, which emphasises the value of patience, present, and introspection. I included images of tea ceremonies in my triptych to represent the beauty of harmonious relationships and to imply that fostering mutual respect and understanding among people may aid in the fight against the widespread problem of gender-based violence.

            <p>Inspired by Chinese Buddhism , Feminine Empowerment , Traditional Chinese Art

She starts in a green-and-red kimono with flower patterns, inspired by Chinese paintings and  geishas 
But by the end, she transforms not just in spirit but in style. Her armor gleams red and gold, symbolizing rage refined into power. She’s gone from delicate to deadly.

Chinese Buddhism places emphasis on internal strength and rebirth, especially through suffering. which fits the narrative from a broken beginning (abuse) to a powerful transformation.
The  kimono reflects cultural beauty and fragility, while her warrior form channels the tiger-hearted strength of Chinese deities and heroines.
Color Symbolism:
Green : Healing, youth, regrowth — the start of her journey.
Red : Dual meaning: in Chinese culture, it’s good luck, passion, power; here, it evolves from pain to purpose.
Gold : Royalty, enlightenment, ultimate strength — she’s not just surviving; she’s thriving.</p>
